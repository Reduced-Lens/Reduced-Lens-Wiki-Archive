# Reduced Lens Wiki Archive
This is the state of wiki.reducedlens.org on 3 July 2024. This is before this version of the wiki was closed due to inactivity in editing and server costs.

## Why was the live version of the website taken down?
The Reduced Lens Wiki was a fork of [EndMyopia Wiki](https://wiki.endmyopia.org/wiki/EndMyopia_Wiki). It was created in May 2023.

Nearly all of the articles on Reduced Lens Wiki were already written long before the fork. Reduced Lens Wiki, just like EndMyopia Wiki, has seen very little editing activity for a long time.

Ultimately, because the content has already been written and such a miniscule number of edits are being made, there is not much point in continuing to pay server costs for a Web 2.0 site, which needs interactivity and a server backend, when the site could just as easily be Web 1.0, which are just plain html files that contain information and can be hosted for free.

## Notes about using the archive
Everything you need is basically in the following folder:
`Reduced Lens Wiki Archive/wiki`
This contains all of the actual content with writings and guides inside of it, preserved as it was.
